### [Discord Bot for the Unofficial RIT Discord](https://github.com/Chris-Bitler/RIT-HAL)

HAL is a discord bot aimed at helping students gain access to information related to the university, along with helping with the maintenance of the discord server.

This includes allowing for things such as
- Adding alerts to be displayed on a daily basis
- Helping streamline the moderation of the server
- Allowing users to contact the admins of the server for help
- Allows students to see bus schedule information
- Allows students to see what food is being served where on campus

#### Technologies in use
HAL was originally written in JS using Node.JS, but has since been rewritten in Typescript to allow the project to be more maintainable.

Other technologies include Jest for unit testing, Circle-CI for continuous integration, and Heroku for Continuous deployment.

#### Contributing
Contributions are welcome to the project as pull requests on the repository or as issues for future improvements that can be added.
